## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

How to change the colour (`fill = "..."`) of an SVG object. This took time to figure out since I attempted this using CSS first, and when it did not work I put my googlefu skills to use and found a StackOverflow solution! How I set up the HTML doc also played a vital part in getting this to work just right, so yes this was the most time consuming part of this challenge.

### Continued development

SVGs. More SVGs. I'm starting to sound like a broken record LMAO

### Useful resources

- [Changing a SVG's Colour using JS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9872947/changing-svg-image-color-with-javascript) - Helped me configure the share icon to change colour when toggled and hovered over.
- [CSS Triangles](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/css-triangle/) - I used to this to make the little tooltip arrow!
